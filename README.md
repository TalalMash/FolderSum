Combined files checksum tool that works on Termux, iSH, Windows, MacOS, and Linux (AMD64,ARM64,ARMv7)

Usage
```
FolderSum(.exe) <folder-path>
```
Example
```
...
Processed 98 of 100 files: /home/user/src/FolderSum/README.md
Processed 99 of 100 files: /home/user/src/FolderSum/go.mod
Processed 100 of 100 files: /home/user/src/FolderSum/main.go
Checksum of all file checksums: c3b02d6fb72d73bd69943aaad86254bf0d4bf60cd752f867277bd6d0f31b4cee
```

Motive: Had corrupted photos during phone to desktop transfer, no phone app calculates a folder checksum.

Termux and iSH scripting is very limited and dependency heavy.
